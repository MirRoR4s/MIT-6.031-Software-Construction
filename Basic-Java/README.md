# [Reading 2:Basic Java](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/classes/02-basic-java/)

**Due the night before class:** you must complete the reading exercises and Java Tutor exercises in this reading by Thursday, February 18 at 10:00 pm US Eastern time. These exercises are graded based on the level of effort you put into them, not on correctness, as described in the [course general info](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/general/#classes_readings_and_nanoquizzes).

**Getting credit for reading exercises:** on the right is a big red ***log in*** button. You will only receive credit for reading exercises if you are logged in when you do them. And again, you will need to put care and attention into the reading exercises in order to get full credit.

**Due before class（上课之前）:** you must complete [Problem Set 0 Part I](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/psets/ps0/) before class on Friday, February 19 at 11:00 am US Eastern time.

Getting started with Java
-------------------------

Read the first six sections of **[From Python to Java](http://kennethalambert.com/pythontojava/)** (27 short pages):

- Program Structure and Execution

- Data Types and Expressions

- Simple Statements

- Terminal Input and Output

- Control Statements

- Objects and Interfaces

In the Java Tutor in Eclipse, complete the first two categories: Basic Java and Numbers & Strings.

After you have done these categories, your Java Tutor pane in Eclipse should show the categories fully checked off with a green checkmark:

✓Numbers & Strings2/2

Then check your understanding by answering some questions about how the basics of Java compare to the basics of Python:
